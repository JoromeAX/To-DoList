# To-DoList
Introducing My Task-Tracking App!

Excited to share a new addition to my portfolio—a To-Do List App designed to demonstrate my skills in creating efficient, intuitive, and data-driven applications. This app allows users to easily add, edit, and sort tasks by priority and date, ensuring a streamlined experience for tracking daily tasks.

Key Features:

    •    Task Management: Add, edit, delete, and organize tasks effortlessly.
    •    Sorting Options: Prioritize tasks based on urgency or due date.
    •    Local Data Storage: Offline data persistence, so users can access their tasks anytime.

Technologies Used:

    •    SwiftUI: For a responsive, dynamic user interface.
    •    SwiftData: To locally save and manage tasks efficiently.
    •    List and ForEach: For efficient task display and sorting.

This project not only showcases my iOS development skills but also highlights my focus on seamless user experience and performance.
